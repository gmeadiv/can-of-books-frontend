# Project Name

**Author**: George Mead and Cameron Walden
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->


## Credit and Collaborations

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- George
Planning and organization

- Cameron 
Organization and technical proficiency

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**

Daily review of code and pair programming to work through problems

**Conflict Resolution**

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**

Both of us will have good communication, but if a serious problem we can JB/SARA?TA's mediate

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**

Good communication to figure out a solution

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

Again, communication to help the other understand the problem/solution
